    authorization:
      description: >
        The gateway can apply authorization rules to incoming requests.
        This entry defines a list of matching requests, rules and actions
        to perform if matches are found.
        The rules can be either:
          * Defined directly here in an entry.
          * Defined in the authorization section and reference by name here in an entry.

        This entry defines authorization rules directly.
        There are also two pre-defined rules which can be used:
          * "anyuser" : Which allows access to any user, even if they are not authenticated.
          * "anyauth" : Which allows access to any authenticated user.

        Example: policies:
                     authorization:
                         - name: policyA
                           host: www.test.com

                           methods: 
                               - GET
                               - POST
                           rule: (any groupIds = "administrator")

              The following macros are available:

              ------|------
              %USERNAME% | The current logged in user, or **unauthenticated** for unauthenticated users.
              %METHOD% | The HTTP method of the request which matched this policy.
              %URL% | The URL the client was attempting to access when this policy was matched.
              %HOSTNAME% | The hostname (HTTP Host header) of the client request which matched this policy.
              %PROTOCOL% | The protocol (**http** or **https**) which was used 
              %CREDATTR{<attribute_name>}% | The value of the credential attribute named by **<attribute_name>**.
              %HTTPHDR{<header_name>}% | The value of the HTTP header from the client request named by **<header_name>**.

              oidc:

                  Authentication parameters which can be used when using an
                  OIDC identity scenario. These parameters are passed as query
                  string parameters when the authorization endpoint is 
                  requested.

      External Authentication Interface, which allows an application
      to assert client identity information to the IBM Application Gateway
      container.
      NB: Please note that this won't be an initially supported identity
      source. It is for internal IBM testing only.

    properties:
      auth_challenge_redirect:
        description: >
          The URI to which a client will be redirected in order to start
          the authentication process. Please note that if this resource
          is hosted by the IBM Application Gateway an access policy which allows
          unauthenticated access to the resource must be created.
        type: string
      triggers:
        description: >
          The list of URLs for which the response could potentially
          contain authentication information.
          Please note that an access policy which allows unauthenticated
          access to this resource must be created.
          The URL string patterns are case-sensitive and may contain
          wild card patterns.
          The format for a regular path-based application is:
          trigger:
            - <URL pattern>
          The format for a Virtual Host application is:
          trigger:
            - http[s]://virtual-host-name[:port]/<URL pattern>
          For Virtual Host applications to match a trigger they must
          also have the same protocol (http[s] = TCP/SSL) and have the
          same virtual-host-name and port as the trigger.

    to assert client identity information to the IBM Application Gateway
    container.

        description: >
          The list of URLs for which the response could potentially
          contain authentication information.
          Please note that an access policy which allows unauthenticated
          access to this resource must be created.
          The URL string patterns are case-sensitive and may contain
          wild card patterns.
          The format for a regular path-based application is:
          trigger:
            - <URL pattern>
          The format for a Virtual Host application is:
          trigger:
            - http[s]://virtual-host-name[:port]/<URL pattern>
          For Virtual Host applications to match a trigger they must
          also have the same protocol (http[s] = TCP/SSL) and have the
          same virtual-host-name and port as the trigger.

    The configuration entries in this section allow the reverse proxy to
    act as an OIDC relying party to IBM Cloud Identity.

    ## Response Type Values
    Name | Description
    ---- | -----------
    code | The authorization code flow will be used to retrieve both an access token and identity token.
    id_token | The implicit flow will be used to retrieve the identity token.
    id_token token | The implicit flow will be used to retrieve both an access token and identity token.

    ## Bearer Token Attrs Format
    A JSON data element from the bearer token response which should be
    included or excluded in the credential as an extended attribute. The format
    of the configuration entry is:

           [+|-]<json-data>

    where:

    Element | Description
    ------- | -----------
    + | Indicates that this JSON data should be added to the credential.
    - | Indicates that this JSON data should not be added to the credential.
    \<json-data\> | The corresponding JSON data name, which can also contain pattern matching characters (i.e. * ?).

    For example the value "-access\_token" indicates that the access_token should not be added to the credential.

    When a bearer token is received each JSON data element will be
    evaluated against each rule in sequence until a match is found.
    The corresponding code (+|-) will then be used to determine whether
    the JSON data will be added to the credential or not. If the JSON
    data name does not match a configured rule it will by default be
    added to the credential.

    ## ID Token Attrs Format
    A claim from the ID token response which should be included or excluded in the
    credential as an extended attribute. The format of the configuration entry is:

           [+|-]<claim>
    
    where:

    Element | Description
    ------- | -----------
    + | Indicates that this claim should be added to the credential.
    - | Indicates that this claim should not be added to the credential.
    \<claim\> | The corresponding claim name, which can also contain pattern matching characters (i.e. * ?).

    For example the value "-email" indicates that the email claim should not be added to the credential.

    When an ID token is received each claim will be evaluated against
    each rule in sequence until a match is found. The corresponding
    code (+|-) will then be used to determine whether the claim will
    be added to the credential or not. If the claim name does not
    match a configured rule it will by default be added to the
    credential.

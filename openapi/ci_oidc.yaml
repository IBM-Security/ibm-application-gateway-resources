    The configuration entries in this section allow the reverse proxy to act as an OIDC relying party to IBM Security Verify.

    ### Notice of Deprecation

    This identity module is no longer preferred and will be removed in a future version. Use the [OIDC](../../yaml-identity/oidc) identity module.

    When using the OIDC identity module, `discovery_endpoint` is given rather than `hostname`.
    

    The format for an IBM Security Verify `discovery_endpoint` is:

    `https://<hostname>/oidc/endpoint/default/.well-known/openid-configuration`

    For example, refer to the IBM Security Verify OIDC configuration below:

    ```yaml
      identity:
        ci_oidc:
          hostname: www.test.com
          client_id: 11111111-2222-3333-4444-5a5a5a5a5a5a5a
          # ...
    ```

    The equivalent OIDC configuration is:

    ```yaml
      identity:
        oidc:
          discovery_endpoint: https://www.test.com/oidc/endpoint/default/.well-known/openid-configuration
          client_id: 11111111-2222-3333-4444-5a5a5a5a5a5a5a
          # ...
    ```

    ### Response Type Values
    Name | Description
    ---- | -----------
    code | The authorization code flow will be used to retrieve both an access token and identity token.
    id_token | The implicit flow will be used to retrieve the identity token.
    id_token token | The implicit flow will be used to retrieve both an access token and identity token.

    ### Bearer Token Attrs Format
    A JSON data element from the bearer token response which should be included or excluded in the credential as an extended attribute.
    The format of the configuration entry is:

    `[+|-]<json-data>`

    where:

    Element | Description
    ------- | -----------
    + | Indicates that this JSON data should be added to the credential.
    - | Indicates that this JSON data should not be added to the credential.
    &lt;json-data&gt; | The corresponding JSON data name, which can also contain pattern matching characters (i.e. * ?).

    For example the value "-access_token" indicates that the access_token should not be added to the credential.

    When a bearer token is received each JSON data element will be evaluated against each rule in sequence until a match is found.
    The corresponding code (+|-) will then be used to determine whether the JSON data will be added to the credential or not.
    If the JSON data name does not match a configured rule it will by default be added to the credential.

    ### ID Token Attrs Format
    A claim from the ID token response which should be included or excluded in the credential as an extended attribute.
    The format of the configuration entry is:

    `[+|-]<claim>`

    where:

    Element | Description
    ------- | -----------
    + | Indicates that this claim should be added to the credential.
    - | Indicates that this claim should not be added to the credential.
    &lt;claim&gt; | The corresponding claim name, which can also contain pattern matching characters (i.e. * ?).

    For example the value "-email" indicates that the email claim should not be added to the credential.

    When an ID token is received each claim will be evaluated against each rule in sequence until a match is found.
    The corresponding code (+|-) will then be used to determine whether the claim will be added to the credential or not.
    If the claim name does not match a configured rule it will by default be added to the credential.

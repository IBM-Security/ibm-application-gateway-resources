    The configuration entries in this section allow the reverse proxy to
    accept an OAuth bearer token and use the configured OAuth introspection
    endpoints to validate the token and create an authenticated session.
    IBM Security Verify, IBM Security Verify Access and IBM Security Access 
    Manager 9.0.7.0+ provide supported OAuth introspection endpoints.
    Multiple introspection endpoints may be different so that different
    providers can be enabled for different resource servers.


    ## Attributes Format
    A JSON data element from the introspection response token which should be
    included or excluded in the credential as an extended attribute. The format
    of the configuration entry is:

           [+|-]<json-data>

    where:

    Element | Description
    ------- | -----------
    + | Indicates that this JSON data should be added to the credential.
    - | Indicates that this JSON data should not be added to the credential.
    \<json-data\> | The corresponding JSON data name, which can also contain 
    pattern matching characters (i.e. * ?).

    For example the value "-exp" indicates that the expiry time of the token
    should not be added to the credential.

    When an introspection response token is received each JSON data element will
    be evaluated against each rule in sequence until a match is found.
    The corresponding code (+|-) will then be used to determine whether
    the JSON data will be added to the credential or not. If the JSON
    data name does not match a configured rule it will by default be
    added to the credential.

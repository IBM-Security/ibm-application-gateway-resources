    The 'authorization' node defines the authorization rules.
  type: object
  properties:

    rules:
      description: |
        The gateway can apply authorization rules to incoming requests. These rules can be either:
          * Defined directly in a policies:authorization entry.
          * Defined here in the authorization section and reference by name in a policies:authorization entry.

        This entry defines authorization rules which can be referred to by name in a
        policies:authorization entry.

        This entry is an array and can be used to specify multiple rules.

        ## Rule Format

        Authorization rules are composed of credential attributes and
        the following operators:
        
        Name | Values
        ---- | ------
        logical operators | and, or, not
        multi-valued operators | any, all
        relational operators | =, !=, matches, >, >=, <, <=, exists

        Parenthesis can be used for controlling the order of evaluation.

        Examples:

        Rule | Description
        ---- | -----------
        (any groupIds = "administrator") | Match when the user is in the administrator group. 
        (all authenticationLevels >= "2") | Match when all credential authenticationLevels are at least level 2.
        (attribute\_a matches "a(?:bc)*") | Match when the value of the credential attribute "attribute\_a" matches the regular expression.
        (level >= "2") and (any groupIds = "forbidden") | Match when the credential attribute "level" is at least level 2 and the user is in the forbidden group.
        (not exists attribute\_c) | Match when the credential does not have an attribute named "attribute\_c".
        (AZN\_CRED\_PRINCIPAL\_NAME = "user\_a") | Match when the credential attribute "AZN\_CRED\_PRINCIPAL\_NAME" is equal to "user\_a".
        
        Example: authorization:
                     rules:
                         - name: ruleA
                           rule: (any groupIds = "administrator")
      type: array
      items:
        type: object
        properties:
          name:
            description: >
              The name which will be given to this authorization rule.
            type: string
          rule:
            description: >
              The authorization rule. See the Rule Format table for a description of the expected format.

        The gateway can apply authorization rules to incoming requests. These rules can be either:
          * Defined directly in a policies:authorization entry.
          * Defined here in the authorization section and reference by name in a policies:authorization entry.

        This entry defines authorization rules which can be referred to by name in a policies/authorization entry.

        This entry is an array and can be used to specify multiple rules.

        ### Rule Format

        Authorization rules are composed of credential attributes and the following operators:

        Name | Values
        ---- | ------
        logical operators | and, or, not
        multi-valued operators | any, all
        relational operators | =, !=, matches, >, >=, <, <=, exists

        Parenthesis can be used for controlling the order of evaluation.

        Examples:

        Rule | Description
        ---- | -----------
        (any groupIds = "administrator") | Match when the user is in the administrator group.
        (all authenticationLevels >= "2") | Match when all credential authenticationLevels are at least level 2.
        (attribute_a matches "a(?:bc)*") | Match when the value of the credential attribute "attribute_a" matches the regular expression.
        (level >= "2") and (any groupIds = "forbidden") | Match when the credential attribute "level" is at least level 2 and the user is in the forbidden group.
        (not exists attribute_c) | Match when the credential does not have an attribute named "attribute_c".
        (AZN_CRED_PRINCIPAL_NAME = "user_a") | Match when the credential attribute "AZN_CRED_PRINCIPAL_NAME" is equal to "user_a".

        These entries can be used to override the default authentication 
        challenge which unauthenticated clients will be redirected to when
        first accessing the reverse proxy.

        If an OIDC identity source is configured, this entry will default to 
        the OIDC authentication URI "/pkmsoidc?iss=default".

        Example: identity:
                   auth_challenge_redirect:
                     url: /eai/login_start
